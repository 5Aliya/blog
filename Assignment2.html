    The index page, this is my home and have the basic content about me. The following pages would look identical but the content it contains would be the separate assignment work. For further detail on it, I have the content all within a wrapper which is 50% of the width of the screen and is centralized with a semi-transparent background to allow the white text to be a little more visible. Multiple pages are red and white all numbered with different fonts sizes different layouts  with images, all pages contains reference link.

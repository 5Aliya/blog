    </h2>
    <p>
            Actually enjoys working with people meeting new people always interested in IT technology Code Nation has been really interesting and I have understood about coding and would be happy to continue with learning more coding.
        
            Information Technology  has developed and will become more advanced in the future whether in Healthcare, Marketing, Stocks and Shares, Education establishments and small/large Businesses, stores through the internet e.g. can book Airline tickets it’s become accessible helps people to work from home get access for conference calls whether through PC or mobiles and for the Public and when I was a University Student I could access the Intranet and email tutor and send through dissertation coursework.

        1.1 Describing the purpose of IT  modern business:
 </h2>
 <p> 
    <br>IT purpose in Modern business is because for information, increases productivity, great for speeding business deals allowing networking, storing documents, transmits, manipulates data, saving time, self service distributing sending much quicker Files and data are now usually digitized rather than relying on paper storage as it is much more convenient this way, it saves physical space, easily accessible and shareable, and it creates a level of security as a computer or file with a password can be safer than a file in a cabinet. <br>
    <br>
    
    
    <h2>
      1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? 

</h2>
<p> 
  <br>To make projects successful:	Good communicator having the ability to communicate with all people at all levels this is mostly important skill by project managers and team members Depending on whether you are working with a team or developing a project for a client, communication tools will be a must as constant communication keeps the project in the right direction and updated with any progress or issues. 	
<p></p> Data collection: This is under 3 three basic groups of research  (quantitative, qualitative and mixed), there are different tools that can be used to collect data. 
  <a href="https://www.goskills.com/Project-Management/Articles/Project-management-skills"> here is a reference read the
  link</a><br>



   <h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your trello board</h2>
   <br>The same issue could apply for any communication or hosting tool being used, a way to minimise this risk would be to create multiple backups on local machines and other hosting sites so there is always availability even if your connection to the internet failed. The other main risk is security, in this case, cybersecurity can be a concern if your files and data is stored online as there is always risk of a hacker gaining access and carrying out any number of tasks; this can be a difficult thing to avoid but there are standard procedures that can be taken to reduce the likeliness of this happening by making it difficult for anyone to get access, such as using secure passwords and only sharing the links (e.g. for trello board) to project members.



<p> 
<br>Here's an example of how you can employ Trello to start managing a content marketing project with your team  You can prioritize which tasks need to be completed first, put them into categories and assign them if there is more than one person working on the project. Provided is a link to my trello board which is being used for creating this website you are currently viewing.

       <li>Create a team space</li>
       <li>Create a board</li>
       <li>Add team members to the team space and boards...</li>
       <li>Create lists...</li>
       <li>Break down tasks into cards...</li>
       <li>Assign tasks to team members...</li>
